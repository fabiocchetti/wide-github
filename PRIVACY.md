# Privacy Policy for Wide GitHub

Wide GitHub is a browser extension that enhances the GitHub interface by making it wide and more readable.  
We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, and with whom it is shared.

---

## What Data We Collect

Wide GitHub **does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data or browsing history** outside of your own browser.

The extension only stores the following information **locally in your browser** or synchronizes it via your browser’s built-in sync features (such as Chrome Sync or Firefox Sync):

- Whether the wide layout is enabled or disabled
- The list of custom domains you have added

No other data is collected, accessed, or transmitted by the extension.

>Why does Wide GitHub request access to all websites?
>
>To support custom GitHub Enterprise or self-hosted domains, Wide GitHub needs permission to run on any URL. This allows you to add any domain where you want the wide layout to be applied. The extension does not collect, transmit, or access any personal data or browsing history—permissions are used only to inject the wide layout on the domains you specify.

---

## How We Use Your Data

The data stored by Wide GitHub is used **solely to provide the extension’s intended functionality**, specifically:

- Remembering your preference for enabling or disabling the wide layout
- Applying the wide layout to GitHub, Gist, GitHub Pages, and any custom domains you specify

This data is **never transmitted to any external server** or third party.

---

## Data Sharing

Wide GitHub **does not share any user data with any third parties**.

All settings and preferences are stored locally in your browser or synchronized using your browser’s built-in sync service (if enabled).  
No data is ever sold, transferred, or used for advertising or analytics.

---

## Permissions

Wide GitHub requests the following permissions:

- **Storage**: To save your extension preferences and custom domains.
- **Host permissions**: To apply the wide layout on GitHub, Gist, GitHub Pages, and any custom domains you specify.
- **activeTab**: To enable or disable the wide layout on the current tab after user interaction.

These permissions are used **only** to provide the extension’s intended functionality and never for tracking, profiling, or collecting personal information.
