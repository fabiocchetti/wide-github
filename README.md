# Wide GitHub

Wide GitHub is a simple add-on that makes the GitHub layout **wide** on Mozilla Firefox.
Now you can really focus on your code.

It works on Mozilla Firefox 57 (Quantum) or superior. Compatible with private GitHub (and some GitHub Enterprise) domains.

### Changelog

**2.1.0**
- Added toggle button on the Firefox toolbar, so that Wide GitHub can now be enabled or disabled on specific pages. ([Issue #7](https://github.com/fabiocchetti/wide-github/issues/7) and [Issue #15](https://github.com/fabiocchetti/wide-github/issues/15).
- Fixed an issue that caused the comment dialog box on pull requests to be wider than the screen in some circumstances ([Issue #16](https://github.com/fabiocchetti/wide-github/issues/16).
